explain about terminal feature in general
explain about the differences between normal Monaca project vs transpilable project

In this section, we will guide you through how you can take advantage of the `integrated terminal` feature of the Monaca Cloud IDE.

# Transpilable project

## Creating new project

You can now create the transpilable projects such as `Angular 2`, `React` and `Vue` without the need of Monaca CLI. To create a project, simply go to `Monaca` -> `Create Project` and choose any project templates you like.

## Importing existing project

Before the new IDE released, there is a limitation that user can only import project consisting of `www/index.html`. However, this limitation has been removed, so now you can also import any existing transpilable projects by navigating to `Monaca` -> `Import Project`.

## Scroll mode

You might notice that once you are scrolling inside the `Terminal` or `Preview Log` console, a little message appeared at the top right corner telling you the current scolling position of the pane. It indicates that you are in the `scroll mode`. Once you scroll down to the buttom of the terminal pane, the `scroll mode` will be exited automically. Otherwise, you can press `ESC` key to leave from the `scroll mode`.
