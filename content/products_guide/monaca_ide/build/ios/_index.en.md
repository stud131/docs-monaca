Starting from April 2018, Apple {{<link title="announces" href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit/">}} that all new iOS apps submitted to the App Store must be built with the iOS 11 SDK. All new apps for iPhone, including universal apps, must support the Super Retina display of iPhone X. For this reason, in order to publish Monaca apps to the AppStore, you must use Cordova 7.1 or higher in your projects.
