Starting March 27, 2019, all iOS apps submitted to the App Store will need to be built with the iOS 12.1 SDK or later, and support the all-screen design of iPhone XS Max or the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (3rd generation). For more information, see {{<link title="Submitting iOS Apps to the App Store" href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit/">}}. For this reason, in order to publish Monaca apps to the AppStore, you must use Cordova 7.1 or higher in your projects.
