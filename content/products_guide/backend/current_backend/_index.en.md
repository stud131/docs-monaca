There is a growing need for mobile apps to have user management
functions which allow users to register and keep their data in a
database. Monaca Backend provides these functionalities in advance as a
cloud-based service that can manage users without a need for server-side
development on the client part.

-   Monaca Backend sample app is described in [Backend Memo](/en/sampleapp/samples/backend_memo/).
-   Monaca Backend API is listed in [Backend API](/en/reference/monaca_api/cloud/).

{{<note>}}
    Monaca Backend plugin is not included in both Monaca Debugger (store-version) and custom Monaca Debugger. Therefore, please build (debug build) your app and install on your device in order to test Monaca Backend operations.
