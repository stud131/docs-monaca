Monaca Cloud IDE provides a browser-based development environment as a
service. Right from your Web browser, all of your Cordova development is
done without any setup. Along with the [Monaca Debugger](/en/products_guide/debugger/), Live
Preview (built-in function in Monaca Cloud IDE) allows you to easily
check the progress of your apps during development.

Before getting started with this tutorial, you will need the following:

- a computer with the Internet connection
- [optional] a smart mobile device (either iOS or Android) if you want to test on a real device
